			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>This is a bunch of stuff about me. I'm writing a lot of nonsense content here to see the layout accurately. I probably have to write at least 4 more sentences for the text to float around the image properly. How do I style the horizontal rule correctly?
			</p>

			<p>Look, another paragraph! This one is presumably going to have more stuff about me. I hate writing about myself. I'm also not sure what image of myself to use. And I'm forgetting how to create a navigation bar in html so that part should be fun.
